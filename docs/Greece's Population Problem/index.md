## Introduction
The country of Greece is infamous for its economy. If it devoted the entirety of the money made in the country  in the span of a year(GDP) to the cause of paying off its national debt, it would still take all of it and more. A slightly lesser known problem Greece has is with its aging population; it is the third oldest in the EU after Italy and Germany. Greece has an elderly population that makes up 19.4% of its total.

## Reasons for these problems
The reasons for this demographic shift are common:
- A post-war baby boom in the 1950s
- Increased strain on public systems because of this elderly generation
- Reduced general opportunities causing low employment
- Emigration for better pay and quality of life

These are generally quite frequent happenings, but other countries may not have had them coincide in such catastrophic ways. Greece was affected worse than the rest of Europe by several financial crises, and this debt has essentially made them dead weight to the EU. Joining in the first place was debated heavily, as Greece didn't seem to have much to offer. Even when they joined the EU in 1981, their debt to GDP was already rising and the country was still poorer than most EU nations. Then, in 2001, they joined the Eurozone and adopted the Euro as legal tender. From a national perspective, this seemed like an easy decision to make. Giving up an unstable local currency for a strong one that increases the ability to trade and make ties with the neighboring countries is generally a great idea, but a few years afterwards, when citizens began to get used to the new currency and it had been fully integrated instead of the drachma, the global financial crisis of 2008 struck, devastating the country. At a similar time, it came to light that the debt to GDP numbers it reported for the years before it joined the EU had deliberately been edited too meet one of the demands of the Maastricht Treaty.
The Maastricht Treaty was a key turning point in the "European Communities" that existed since the end of World War II becoming the European Union as we know it today. It introduced some integral measures to the Union such as:
-  Increasing requirements of cooperation between member states
-  Creating the concept of EU citizenship that gives anyone residing within a member state the ability to live, work, and vote in any other member state as well as their own.
-  The introduction of a shared currency that would integrate member states further, the Euro.
-  Created a framework through which non-member states could apply, including a restriction that *the applying state must have a debt to GDP ratio below 60%* at time of applying.
Greece did not meet this requirement, so the government changed the figures shown in the fiscal statements of the years prior. Then, right after recovery from the financial crisis, the Syrian Civil War broke out, and with
